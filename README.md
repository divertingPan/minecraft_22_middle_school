# 我的世界-新乡市二十二中学

这里是我的世界1.18.2版本的新乡市二十二中学地图存档。这个项目从2013年8月18号放下第一块砖头，缝缝补补一直到今天。只是自娱自乐的一个地图，边缘的建模非常糙，等校园主体做差不多再说边缘的建模吧）

这个地图的主要参照是2012年的校园，当然校园现在已经完全变样了，只剩临街的大楼还大致一样。当前的建造只能依靠记忆或残存的影像或者纯想象了。

一些建筑的内部结构部分很难，可能很难再还原当初的结构了，只能合理自由发挥。

如果有校友想要参与建设可以自己拿存档下去做，然后提交PR。暂时没有开服的计划，主要是没时间。

这个存档也陪伴我见证了MC画质的进步。

下面是一些图片记录展示。


# minecraft_22_middle_school
This is a Minecraft 1.18.2 save with the map of Xinxiang No.22 middle school. This project was initially started on Aug. 18. 2013 when the first block was placed. I keep constructing it till today. I think it's great to save it on Github and share it. The modeling is coarse at the edges of the map. After the main campus is done, I may consider fixing the edges. 

The campus is mainly based on the school in 2012. The real campus is changed totally (maybe the only same thing is the building on the street). The reference of the following construction is only the photos or even our memory. 

The interior is difficult to reproduce. We need to open our minds to designing it. 

Feel free to download and pull requests if any alumni want to play it, fix it, or construct it. I'm not planning to maintain a server for it because it is really exhausted.

Screenshots of the campus record the progress of the display quality of Minecraft.



Here is the map of the campus:

This is the first building in this project, and this is the third year student building:
